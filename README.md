# Eric Gafos - Data Analysis Portfolio


## Introduction

Hello!

Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Eric and I am excited to have you here. 

In this repository, you will come across several projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data exploration, statistcal analysis, data visualization, data cleaning and presentation skills, etc. Majority of my projects are done using SQL, PowerBI, Tableua and excel. In the following section of this README, I will provide a short summary of my data journey and and future projects. 

## About & Data Journey 

I have a social science background and hold a Bachelor of Arts (B.A) degree in Sociology from Mount Royal University. I am currently a Health Research Interviewer collecting data for health status reporting and service deliver planning. During undergraduate school, I developed a passion for social research to better understand social structures and patterns to develop and enrich our community. Recently, I had the opportunity to practice my data-related skills through self-learning courses building off my previous knowledge of social statistics. I look forward to continous learning in data science and positively impacting others through data-drvien decisions. 

The projects shown above demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.
