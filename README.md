# Eric Gafos - Data Analysis Portfolio


## Introduction

Hello, and welcome to my data analyst portfolio. I'm Eric, and I'm thrilled to have you here.

Within this collection of projects, you'll discover my passion for data exploration, statistical analysis, data visualization, and effective data presentation. These are just a few of the skills I've honed along my data journey. The majority of my projects leverage SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, and Excel to uncover insights and tell data-driven stories. In this README, I'll provide a concise overview of my background and aspirations in data science, as well as a glimpse into my future projects.

## About & Data Journey 

With a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology from Mount Royal University, my journey into the world of data analysis started with a deep appreciation for understanding social structures and patterns to enrich our communities. My current role as a Health Research Interviewer involves collecting data for health status reporting and service delivery planning, aligning my background with the analytical world.

As a self-learner, I've embarked on a path to develop and enhance my data skills, building upon my foundation in social statistics. My goal is to continue learning in the field of data science and, in turn, make a positive impact on decision-making through data-driven insights.

The projects you'll find below showcase my ability to not only analyze data but also to present it in a clear, visually appealing manner, ensuring decision-makers can easily grasp the insights and take meaningful action. They represent my dedication to learning, my passion for data, and my commitment to making a difference through the power of information.
